Welcome to a demo of the Multi-Objective Simultaneous Optimistic Optimization algorithm.

- Demo Contents:
	* MOSOO.p : the algorithm encoded in pcode (it will be released as an open source upon publication)
	* paretofront.c: a MEX MATLAB code to perform the non-dominated operator efficiently. We have provided the corresponding binaries for several platforms
	     If for any reason, the binaries are not compatible with your machine, you can recompile with the matlab command:
		 >> mex paretofront.c
	*run_MOSOO_Demo : demonstrates and visualizes MO-SOO on the worked example presented in the paper.
